      <h2>Our Team</h2>
      <p>Equality is a fundamental principle that recognizes that all individuals should have the same rights, opportunities, and treatment regardless of their background, gender, race, religion, or any other personal characteristic. It means that everyone should be treated with fairness and impartiality, and no one should be discriminated against or disadvantaged because of their differences. Achieving equality requires a commitment to social justice and a willingness to challenge unjust systems and practices that perpetuate inequality. Ultimately, creating a more equal society benefits everyone by promoting diversity, tolerance, and respect for human dignity.</p>
      <p>Our team is made up of experienced professionals who are dedicated to delivering the best possible experience for our customers. We work together to ensure that every project is completed to the highest standard.</p>

      <h2>About The Author</h2>
      <h5>Who is she?</h5>
      <p>Nguyen Ngoc Mai is the author behind the Equality. She is student from American International School of VietNam. Her work across multiple disciplines broadly addresses narratives of gender equality. As a student, Nguyen Ngoc Mai has a passion for mathematics and coding. His work has appeared on Mindx. </p>
      <h5>Why did she create this website?</h5>
      <p>Gender equality is important because it is a fundamental human right and a crucial element of social justice. It ensures that all individuals, regardless of their gender identity, have equal access to opportunities, resources, and power. When gender inequality exists, it can lead to a wide range of social, economic, and political problems, such as discrimination, violence, poverty, and exclusion. There are problems with gender inequality that Nguyen Ngoc Mai wants to share with the global citizens so that we could improve the world and make it better. Sharing information about gender equality that happens around the world could help to build this world a better place. </p>
