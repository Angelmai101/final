        "subtitle":"Did you know that each extra year of schooling that a mother receives reduces the risk of infant mortality by 5 to 10%? In fact, if all women had a secondary education, child deaths would be cut in half, saving 3 million lives a year. Likewise, a child born to a mother who can read is 50% more likely to reach their fifth birthday. And if all mothers completed their primary education, maternal deaths would be reduced by two thirds, saving 98,000 lives.",
        "subtitle1":"And saving lives is really just the tip of the iceberg: A quality education for girls would also improve child nutrition, reduce child marriages and teen pregnancies, and reduce the pay gap between men and women. Not to mention offering women a pathway to financial independence.Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa only 8% of girls finish secondary school. In Ireland that figure is 93%. Imagine what could be achieved if we could start to close that gap? If every woman in sub-Saharan Africa had secondary education, 1.8 million lives could have been saved between 2003 and 2008 – lives of under-5-year-olds who died from malnutrition and illness. These numbers were published by UNESCO in its Global Monitoring Report 2011. The report argues that education improves child and maternal health because it equips women with information about nutrition, illness and infection, and empowers them to make their own choices and take control of their lives. Maternal education is one of the strongest factors influencing children’s prospects for survival.",

        "heading":"#2. It reduces poverty",
        "subtitle":"Poverty rates are the highest among young girls. As boys and girls get older, the gender gap in poverty gets larger. This is likely because girls don’t receive the same education and job opportunities as boys, and when girls marry, they often don’t work. Gender inequality keeps women and their families trapped in cycles of poverty. When women receive better education, healthcare, and job opportunities, they can thrive. Investing in gender inequality is a sustainable, highly-effective way to reduce poverty. One of the main causes of poverty is inequality. The systemic barriers that lead to groups of people going without representation in their communities leaves them further behind in terms of resources and opportunity. In order for a community, or even a country, to alleviate poverty, all groups and identities must be involved in creating solutions.         ",
        "subtitle1":"The employment rate in the EU will rise substantially if women have more equal opportunities in STEM education and the labour market. This would lead to an increase in the EU employment rate of 0.5 to 0.8 percentage points by 2030 and of 2.1 to 3.5 percentage points by 2050. In 2050 the EU employment rate will reach almost 80% if substantial gender equality improvements are achieved. Without such improvements, the rate would be 76%. If more women join the labour force and/or study in fields with skill shortages that have good future employment prospects, e.g. STEM diciplines, they are likely to find employment and make substantial contributions to the economy.

        "subtitle":"When women make their own reproductive choices, they provide better care for the children they do have. With income options equal to men, mothers can offer education, healthcare, and healthier food to their children. Studies also show that reduced infant mortality is linked to higher levels of education. Children raised in gender-equal environments will do better than those raised with inequality.",
        "subtitle1":"Each day, almost 1,000 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. The chronic absence of healthcare, combined with the ongoing, unnecessary loss of so many women result in massive negative impacts on families and communities. Children of sick mothers are less likely to access healthcare themselves, and older siblings are usually forced to drop out of school to take care of younger siblings and contribute to the household. When women receive quality care, this not only impacts their health and that of their family’s, but also entire communities. ",

        "subtitle":"Because of their lack of empowerment and resources in many places, women and girls face life-threatening risks. Natural disasters are one example. At the 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction, experts discussed how gender inequality plays a role in death and injury. Other data shows that climate change, which makes natural disasters more dangerous, puts women and girls in even more vulnerable positions. Bringing a gender perspective into discussions allows women to play a bigger role in their own protection. ",

Studies also show that reduced infant mortality is linked to higher levels of education. Children raised in gender-equal environments will do better than those raised with inequality. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It's essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right.",
